# Reducing-Serious-Road-Accidents-UK-2020-Analysis

Conducted an in-depth analysis of UK road accident data to identify patterns and factors contributing to serious accidents (3+ casualties). Utilized advanced data cleaning, exploration, and visualization techniques to uncover key insights, including:

Serious accidents peaked during weekends, especially Saturday afternoons (4-5 PM).
Single carriageways and rural areas had the highest incidence rates.
Lack of pedestrian crossing facilities and poor lighting conditions were significant contributors.
Higher speed limits and wet road surfaces increased accident severity.
Developed actionable recommendations, including enhancing road infrastructure, improving lighting, increasing police presence during critical periods, and implementing targeted public awareness campaigns. The analysis provided critical inputs to the UK Department of Transportâ€™s road safety team to design interventions aimed at reducing fatalities and improving traffic safety.
